# Flappy Bird Clone

## Description

This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, created using the Godot Engine. The goal of this project was to replicate the core mechanics and gameplay of the original Flappy Bird while learning and applying game development principles. It's the first game of the 20 Games Challenge.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Tap or click to make the bird flap its wings and navigate through the pipes.
- **Endless Gameplay**: The game continues indefinitely, challenging the player to achieve the highest score possible.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

## Accomplishments

- **Game Mechanics**: Successfully implemented the core mechanics of Flappy Bird, including gravity, flapping, and collision detection.
- **User Interface**: Created a simple and intuitive user interface that displays the current score and game over screen.
- **Art and Assets**: Designed and integrated custom sprites and backgrounds to enhance the visual appeal of the game.
- **Optimization**: Ensured smooth performance and responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game.
2. Tap or click to make the bird flap its wings.
3. Navigate through the gaps between the pipes.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the pipes or the ground.

## Technologies Used

- **Godot Engine**: Used for game development and scripting.
- **C#**: The primary scripting language used to implement game logic.
- **Custom Assets**: Aseprite for Art, jsfxr for SFX and BeepBox for music


## Conclusion

This Flappy Bird clone project was a great learning experience in game development using the Godot Engine. It provided valuable insights into game mechanics, user interface design, and optimization techniques.
